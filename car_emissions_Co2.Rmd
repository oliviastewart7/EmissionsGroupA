## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#read in data set
Yugo_emissions <- carData |>
  select(day, co2, car, dev) |>
  filter(car == "Yugo") |>
  group_by(day, dev) |>
  summarise(Avg_emission = mean(co2, na.rm = TRUE))

Yugo_Co2 <- ggplot(Yugo_emissions, aes(x = day, y = Avg_emission, colour = dev, group = dev)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +  # Line color and thickness
  geom_point(size = 2) +  # Add points for clarity
  labs(title = "Yugo Co2 Emissions", x = "Day", y = "Co2 Emissions") +
  theme_minimal()

Bentley_emissions <- carData |>
  select(day, co2, car, dev) |>
  filter(car == "Bentley") |>
  group_by(day, dev) |>
  summarise(Avg_emission = mean(co2, na.rm = TRUE))

Bentley_Co2 <- ggplot(Bentley_emissions, aes(x = day, y = Avg_emission, colour = dev, group = dev)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +  # Line color and thickness
  geom_point(size = 2) +  # Add points for clarity
  labs(title = "Bentley Co2 Emissions", x = "Day", y = "Co2 Emissions") +
  theme_minimal()

Yugo_Co2
Bentley_Co2
  
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
