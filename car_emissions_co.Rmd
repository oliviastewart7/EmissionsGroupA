```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# read in the dataset and remove NAs
cars <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/EmissionsGroupA/carData.csv")
cars <- na.omit(cars)
emissions <- cars %>% 
  select(- X)
```

```{r} 
# get the average co for each day
day_avg <- emissions %>%
  filter(day %in% 1:13) %>%   # Select days 1 to 13
  group_by(day) %>%           # Group by day
  summarise(avg_co = mean(co, na.rm = TRUE))  # Compute the mean
emissions <- left_join(emissions, day_avg, by = "day")
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
