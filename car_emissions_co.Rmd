```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r cars}
#read in the dataset and remove NAs
cars <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/EmissionsGroupA/carData.csv")
cars <- na.omit(cars)
cars %>% 
  select(- X)
```

```{r} 

```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
