Project Description:

Introduction
This project analyzes carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from Yugo and Bentley vehicles over a 13-day period, comparing emissions with and without an installed emissions reduction device. The goal is to determine whether the device effectively reduces CO emissions while increasing CO₂ emissions as claimed by the manufacturer.


Project Goals
1.     Determine whether the device is works as the manufacturer claims

2.      Make conclusions about whether the device is effective
